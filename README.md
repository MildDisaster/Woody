Making Crypto, Nvidia and Centos play nice

=========================================================================
Goal here is to make my own Centos7 and NVIDIA based etherium mining rig.
With eventual support for headless operation and overclocking features.
And preference for minimal software sprawl.
=========================================================================

... very much a work in progress
